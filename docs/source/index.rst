PHAS0048 Project Documentation
===================================

Here the :doc:`Model Exploration` section contains the compiled resources that were used in constructing an alternative model, with values for the PECs, AMCs, SOCs, DMCs, taken from literature instead of being calculated. The :doc:`Lifetime Calculation` section is comprised of the relevant programs and data used in producing the reported lifetime calculations and photodissociation spectra.

.. note::

   The `Duo <https://duo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ and `ExoCross <https://exocross.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#>`_ program were required for the lifetime calculation and spectra production.

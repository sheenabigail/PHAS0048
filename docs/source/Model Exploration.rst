Model Exploration
=====

Resources that contained experimental and theoretcial lifetimes of the A2Sigma+ state of SH were first compiled into a `folder <https://github.com/sheenabigail/PHAS0048/blob/main/supp_code/resources/LITERATURE.zip>`_. The tabular and graphical data for the PEC, SOC, AMC, and DMC of SH were then put together in a `presentation <https://github.com/sheenabigail/PHAS0048/blob/main/supp_code/resources/CURVES%20FOR%20DUO.pptx>`_ to be selected. The values of the selected curves were tabulated in an `excel file <https://github.com/sheenabigail/PHAS0048/blob/main/supp_code/curve_lit_data.xlsx>`_.

The tabulated values were then adapted into a `Duo input format <https://github.com/sheenabigail/PHAS0048/tree/main/supp_code/pec_files>`_ , an example for the PEC is 

.. literalinclude:: ../../supp_code/pec_files/PEC_08BrHaHo.dat
   :language: python

Similarly, adaptations were made for the `SOC <https://github.com/sheenabigail/PHAS0048/tree/main/supp_code/soc_files>`_, `AMC <https://github.com/sheenabigail/PHAS0048/blob/main/supp_code/AMC_95Ma.dat>`_, and `DMC <https://github.com/sheenabigail/PHAS0048/blob/main/supp_code/DMC_85SeWeRoRe.dat>`_ files.
